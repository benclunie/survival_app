# survival_app v2.0.1

R Shiny app for survival analysis and plotting Kaplan-Meier survival figures. This repo contains working code for the app and test data to run that include both treatment and dose.

To Do:

-   Fix data input issues - only reading one observation and struggling with 0 values in the status column

-   Introduce customisation options for faceting and accessibility.

-   Test!
